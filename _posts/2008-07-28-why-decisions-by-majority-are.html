Comcast is a company who's success has been driven by providing content to the public based on what the majority wants/demands.  They cover their legal behinds by implementing censorship of the minority.  When it comes to their Internet provision, they do not offer Internet service, but rather offer a limited and constrained service that works well the majority but is piss-poor for the various minority needs.<br/><br/>I've been using Comcast as a backup internet connection because DSL is unreliable and that's the only alternative I have available is this under-developed part of the country.<br/><br/>I continue to find limitations and active censorship of data transmission on the comcast network.  I hear reports of unreliable IRC connectivity (which I seem to be experiencing this morning).  I have complained about their denial of allowing certain legitimate traffic, but they refuse, claiming it's better for the common good.<br/><br/>Of course, in the corporate realm, this practice is perfectly acceptable, even though it goes against the principles of the country in which this company operates.<br/><br/>I have a good deal of respect for the considerations companies have to make.  Nevertheless, I feel that Comcast is willfully censoring and degrading their service, and while this practice may be good for their company, it's detrimental to my situation and detrimental to their customers.<br/><br/>So <a href="http://www.f-comcast.com/">F*** Comcast</a>.
