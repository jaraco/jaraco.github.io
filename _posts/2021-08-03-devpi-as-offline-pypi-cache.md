title: Using devpi as an offline PyPI cache
---

Want to develop Python applications, but realize the dependence on the network and PyPI is a hindrance? [devpi](https://devpi.net) provides a robust way to keep a cache of all the packages you need to develop. And it's super-easy.

# Install devpi

First, install devpi as an application somewhere on your system. [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) provides a great way to do that:

```

~ $ pipx install devpi-server
  installed package devpi-server 6.1.0, Python 3.9.6
  These apps are now globally available
    - devpi-export
    - devpi-fsck
    - devpi-gen-config
    - devpi-gen-secret
    - devpi-import
    - devpi-init
    - devpi-passwd
    - devpi-server
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨

~ $ devpi-init

```

Now a locally-running PyPI mirror is running at `localhost:3141/root/pypi/`!

Leave that server running in its own window or tab.

# Prime the cache

Although the server is running, it does not yet have a mirror of the packages needed to build and test the project. To get those, in a separate terminal, install the relevant project(s) or run the project's test suite using devpi as the package index:

```sh
~ $ $PIP_INDEX_URL = 'http://localhost:3141/root/pypi/'
~ $ # or in bash:
~ $ # export PIP_INDEX_URL=http://localhost:3141/root/pypi/
~ $ pip-run -q jaraco.mongodb pmxbot pip-run jupyter -- -c pass
```

By setting `PIP_INDEX_URL`, pip will now request packages from the local index, which will mirror the packages from PyPI and keep a local cache.

Although this example uses [pip-run](https://pypi.org/project/pip-run) to download the packages, one could just as easily use `pip` or `tox`.

If priming the cache using tox, be sure to pass `-r` to tox to rebuild the environments from scratch to get all packages.


# Testing the cache

Next, test that the cache is working by disabling the network and putting devpi in offline mode.

```
~ $ sudo ifconfig en0 down
Password:
~ $ ping pypi.org
ping: cannot resolve pypi.org: Unknown host
```

To restart devpi in offline mode, kill the existing process by hitting Ctrl+C in the devpi-server terminal and re-launch with `--offline-mode`:

```

```

Now observe that the install commands that ran previously will succeed entirely without network access:

```
~ $ pip-run -q jaraco.mongodb pmxbot pip-run jupyter -- -c "import jupyter; print('worked!')"
worked!
```

# Beyond a mirror

Devpi can do so much more, including providing development indexes to store non-public packages or packages under development (while still mirroring upstream repos).

It also provides for repository replication, allowing your team to share a devpi instance with public and private packages and then developers can sync a replica of that instance with all the public and private packages used by the team.

Be sure to check out https://devpi.net for more details.
