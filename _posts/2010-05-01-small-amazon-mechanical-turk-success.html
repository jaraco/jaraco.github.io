Today, I got the opportunity to try out <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> (as a requester). For a long time, I've been excited about the potential a system like Mechanical Turk creates, and I'd been interested to put it to a real-world test. If you're not familiar with the Mechanical Turk, it's a market place for (typically small) jobs that require human intelligence. The saying goes, &quot;artificial intelligence is hard so Amazon's Mechanical Turk is Artificial Artificial Intelligence.&quot; I first heard about an interesting application of the Turk reading <a href="http://waxy.org/2008/09/girl_turk/">Girl Turk</a>, where Andy Biao leverages mechanical turk to perform research on the genres of the music sampled in the Girl Talk album <i>Feed the Animals</i> (which I ended up buying).<br /><br />Fast forward to today, where I&nbsp;was stuck with a problem. I&nbsp;had a four-page real estate agreement that I&nbsp;needed to customize, but I&nbsp;only had the scanned copy. I&nbsp;ran it through Acrobat's OCR and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">tesseract-ocr</a>, neither of which created results even close to usable (the corrections process would have taken longer than retyping the documents by hand).<br /><br />I&nbsp;tried typing the document by hand, but i&nbsp;found typing a single paragraph took me approximately 10 minutes, so I&nbsp;felt it would be worth my time to investigate a process that would be repeatable.<br /><br />So I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;would give the Turk a try. I&nbsp;registered and started to create my first Human Intelligence Task (HIT). Since HITs work best when they're balanced and small, I&nbsp;decided to break up my job into four HITs (one for each page). I&nbsp;would have preferred to break it up into even smaller chunks (just paragraphs), but that would have required more intelligent processing, but the pages I&nbsp;could separate mechanically.<br /><br />The Amazon <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/bulk/hit_templates">sample HIT&nbsp;templates</a> didn't include anything for typing a page (most samples are for small things like &quot;answer a simple question&quot; or &quot;flag questionable content&quot;). So I&nbsp;created my own template. It was simple and easy. I&nbsp;used their HTML&nbsp;editor to create some short instructions, an iframe to contain the PDF page, and a text box below to enter the text. At Amazon's suggestion, I&nbsp;also included a comment box at the end where the worker could include whatever feedback they wanted. The template contains exactly one variable, &quot;PAGE_URL&quot;&nbsp;which is the URL&nbsp;to the PDF&nbsp;PAGE&nbsp;to be displayed.<br /><br />In order to create each of the HITs, I&nbsp;had to do two things:<ol><li>Split the document into separate pages.</li><li>Supply Amazon with a CSV containing the PAGE_URL values. Since a CSV with only one field is trivial, I&nbsp;just needed a text document containing the word PAGE_URL, followed by each of the urls on separate lines.</li></ol>I&nbsp;then wrote a quick Python <a href="https://svn.jaraco.com/jaraco/python/jaraco.util/jaraco/util/turk.py">script to prep any PDF</a>&nbsp;for the above steps and generate the job file to be uploaded to Amazon. The script uses <a href="http://www.accesspdf.com/pdftk/">pdftk</a> to do the actual splitting.<br /><br />Finally, I&nbsp;loaded $4.40 into my amazon turk account and created the HITs (worth $1 each plus Amazon takes $.1). I&nbsp;wasn't sure at that price if the job would get done, but in less than two hours, I&nbsp;had all four pages typed, each which took the workers an average of 45 minutes each to type. Two of the workers responded that they hoped I&nbsp;was happy with the job and were eager to do more.<br /><br />Then, Amazon gives me a link to the results which is returned as a comma-separated file, with one of the columns containing the full text of the page that was hand-typed by the worker.<br /><br />I&nbsp;was so happy with the results, I swiped my credit card for another $4 and gave a $1 bonus to each worker.<br /><br />But what a bargain. Instead of typing something up, I&nbsp;got to program in Python and create something that was repeatable, while at the same time trading approximately 3 hours of typing for an hour of programming and $8.40.<br /><br />The next step, of course, is to learn the Amazon Turk API&nbsp;and set up a site so others can upload their scanned PDFs and they can swipe their credit card with me (for the service of handling the pages and brokering the exchange).
