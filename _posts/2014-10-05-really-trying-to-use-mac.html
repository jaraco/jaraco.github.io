I've spent literally decades in DOS/Windows and have a great deal of expertise in that platform. Nevertheless, the writing is on the wall that Mac is on the rise and Windows is in decline.<br /><br />So I've been using a Mac Mini hosted with macminivault.com. I've been using it remotely with the iRAPP client.<br /><br />That whole arrangement has been a convenient way to get my feet wet.<br /><br />It's also allowed me to encounter some of the early problems I would encounter in an attempt to transition.<br /><br />Today, I found that I'm unable to pair the OS X with Exchange and that it's a <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5725837">known problem</a>. The reported workarounds didn't work for me. Therefore, I can't configure mail or contacts.<br /><br />I've also found that common keyboard shortcuts use different keys. Copy is Windows+C instead of Ctrl+C. Same for Paste, Undo.<br /><br />These challenges seem small, but add a pretty large impediment to having a partial transition.
