Today I had particularly ugly experiences with two companies that reflected the unaccounted cost to society of the disorganized nature of call centers and other phone-based customer support.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into the details, but I've escalated my complaints.  If they don't reach a satisfactory end, expect to see some flaming posts detailing my experiences.<br/><br/>Raaaaargh!
