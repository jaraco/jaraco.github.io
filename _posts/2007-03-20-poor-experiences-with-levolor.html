Here's my letter to Levolor.  What a mess.  It seems they jerk their customers around and don't care.  I haven't received a response to my request nor have I yet received a replacement slat.  I hope those of you who read this for updates on my life enjoy the read as an humerous aside.  I hope that the rest of you have found this in search for information about Levolor and it will help influence your decision to go with another supplier.<br/><br/>By the way, I did submit a compliant to BBB, for which Levelor is a certified member, but it appears the BBB does not deal with consumer-getting-jerked-around-by-member-company complaints, so they've let me know.<br/><br/>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Jason R. Coombs <br/>Sent: Monday, 12 March, 2007 14:55<br/>To: 'anissa.reid@levolor.com.certified.readnotify.com'<br/>Subject: RE: Levolor.com: Slat mis-cut<br/><br/>Dear Anissa,<br/>	I have to say I am extremely unhappy with the service I have<br/>received from Levolor.<br/><br/>	It's taken every ounce of self-control I have not to write a letter<br/>with gross explicatives.  <br/><br/>	When I first received my blinds, there was a manufacturing defect.<br/>A single slat had the notches mis-cut, so the slat rested 1/2" out of<br/>alignment with the others, causing the other blind to run into it when drawn<br/>up or down.<br/><br/>	I first contacted Levolor via e-mail.  The first representative<br/>indicated that I needed to provide the correct measurements from another<br/>slat so they could properly replace the slat.  These blinds are very large,<br/>so it was a difficult job to measure the slat, but I did do so.  I<br/>double-measured to be sure to provide precise and accurate measurements.  I<br/>sent the results via e-mail to ensure accuracy.<br/><br/>	I then received a response in which the representative required me<br/>to get the all of the numbers from the inside of the head rail.  I<br/>reluctantly performed that task this morning, which involved the following<br/>steps:<br/><br/>	- going downstairs to retrieve my ladder<br/>	- removing my TV screen mounted in front of the blinds<br/>	- releasing the first valence clip<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- releasing the second valence clip<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- releasing the third valence clip<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- releasing the fourth valence clip<br/>	- releasing one blind retention clip<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- releasing the second blind retention clip<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- removing the blinds from the headrail and reading the numbers to<br/>my girlfriend; this is very difficult as the blinds weigh around 50 lbs<br/>	- replacing the blinds<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- engaging the first blind retention clip<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- engaging the second blind retention clip<br/>	- replacing the first valence clip<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- replacing the second and third valence clips<br/>	- moving the ladder<br/>	- replacing the fourth valence clip<br/>	- replacing the TV screen<br/>	- returning the ladder to the storage unit<br/><br/>	I then call the phone number that the previous rep had given me and<br/>I explain the situation.  All she requires is the bill of lading number,<br/>which is on three different pieces of paper I had sitting around the house.<br/>I mentioned nothing of my previous contacts with representatives, and she<br/>was able to complete the process without any mention of touching the blinds.<br/><br/>	In other words, I probably didn't have to get up from my desk.  The<br/>entire process could have been completed easily if<br/>	- the _first_ or _second_ representatives I had worked with had used<br/>the order number I supplied to determine the bill of lading<br/>	- the _first_ or _second_ representatives I had worked with has<br/>simply asked me for the information they needed<br/>	- or your web site had a form that provided detailed instructions on<br/>how to get these sorts of problems resolved<br/>	- or my problem was handled by the same person each time, rather<br/>than a different person with a different approach each time<br/>	- or your QA team had caught the error in the first place<br/><br/><br/>	Needless to say, I've spent too much time on this already.<br/><br/>	If you would like to keep me as a happy customer, I request that you<br/>apologize for the actions of your staff and provide me evidence that this<br/>problem will be resolved for you customers in the future.<br/><br/>	If this is not possible, you can compensate me for my time and<br/>trouble.  A check for $100 would satisfy me and assure me that this is not<br/>business-as-usual.  Considering that I've already spent $2000 toward Levolor<br/>blinds, this is not an unreasonable request.<br/><br/>	If you need to take this request to your supervisor, please do so.<br/>If you need to contact me to resolve this matter, also please do so.  My<br/>phone number is 505.459.6655.<br/><br/>	If you don't care to settle this matter with me directly, I will be<br/>happy to take my complaint to the better business bureau and to post my<br/>detailed experiences publically.  I can't be sure that doing so will resolve<br/>the problem for future customers, but I will at least feel as if I'm not the<br/>only one taking the hit.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jason R.

I had a very busy week and so am just now<br/>getting<br/>around to measuring the slat.<br/><br/>Measuring from the left, the notch positions are:<br/><br/>6", 25.25", and 45.25".  The total slat width is 50.75".<br/><br/>Please let me know if I can provide more information, and thanks for<br/>your<br/>help.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jason R.

My name is Crystal and I<br/>will be glad to assist you.      <br/><br/>Additional information is needed in order to assist you properly. Please<br/>respond via email with the notch measurements on the slat. The way these<br/>need to be measured is starting from the far left of the slat to the<br/>center of the 1st notch, then from far left to the center of the 2nd<br/>notch and so on to the last notch. Once we get that information we can<br/>send you out a new slat and that should fix your problem.<br/><br/>If I can be of further assistance, please contact us at<br/>Info@Levolor.com. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Crystal Edwards<br/>Levolor / Kirsch Customer Service<br/><br/><br/>-----Original Message-----<br/>From: Jason R.

I have a single slat that<br/>wasn't cut correctly in my blind.  It's the second to the bottom on<br/>the left blind.<br/><br/>It appears the right and left notches were cut about 1.5cm off.  The<br/>center notch is probably okay.  This causes the blind to rest off<br/>center and the right blind to run into it.<br/><br/>Can you please send a replacement slat for this set?<br/><br/>I can make photos available.  I can also provide additional<br/>information if necessary.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you<br/>need additional information.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jason R.
