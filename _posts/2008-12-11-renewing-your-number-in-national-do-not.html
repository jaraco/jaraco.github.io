Over the past 3-4 weeks, I've started receiving regular solicitations on my cell phone.  I registered this number with the <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/">national do not call registry</a> shortly after it was launched about 5 years ago.  Most people don't know that the registration expires after 5 years... so if you've registered more than 5 years ago, don't forget to renew you registration.  It's quick and easy.
