This morning, my printer was goatse'd.<br/><br/>(link no longer available)<br /><br/><br/>I guess I can't just leave port 9100 open to the world anymore.  I had for the past 5 years with minimal problems.  That meant I could print from anywhere, and when I got home, the printout would be waiting for me.<br/><br/>I'll probably open it back up again later, perhaps with some gerry-rigged authentication.
