I'm now pretty well settled into Washington, D.C..  [Jason ponders how to properly punctuate that previous sentence.]<br/><br/>So anyway, this weekend I was visited by friends (without blogs) (seriously?) (yeah, no blogs; and they're young blokes).<br/><br/>We decided to go to the Arlington Cemetary.  You see, since I'm a native now, I can't do tourist things unless my friends visit me (hint, hint).<br/><br/>So, we went to the cemetary.  I made some bad jokes about cemetaries, goths, and death.  I got bad looks, but had a good time.  I wasn't too obnoxious.<br/><br/>During our visit, there was also a spectacular <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/14/AR2006101400484.html">Air Force Memorial Opening</a>.  We were not at the memorial dedication, but we did see some of the arial displays, including a fly-over of a Stealth Bomber.  The sight was ominous and spectacular.  I imagined that a flyover of an earlier plane would have been similarly ominous in earlier decades.<br/><br/>In addition, they had some air stunts, flyovers of various Air Force models, most of which I could not accurately identify.  It was quite a good day to be in D.C..
