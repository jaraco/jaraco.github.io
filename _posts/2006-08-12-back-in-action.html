Okay, so I've been off the radar a while.<br /><br />I've had a lot of things going on.  I still do, but I'm unloading a lot of that real soon.<br /><br />I've taken a job in D.C.  I'll be out there sometime in October.<br /><br />I'm <a href="http://albuquerque.craigslist.org/rfs/193325107.html">selling my house</a> and <a href="http://www.jaraco.com/asp/craigslist.htm">most of my stuff</a>.<br /><br />I'm getting healthy again, and I feel like I have more free time and energy.  Things are going great.  D.C. ought to be quite interesting.  I'll be living in a real city.  I'm still not entirely sure what that means.  One thing I know, I'll be able to get high quality broadband from <a href="http://www.megapath.com/">Speakeasy (now Megapath)</a> at one of their major hubs.  That should mean sub 40ms ping times to anywhere in the U.S.  My ping time to the ISP router is 90ms+ right now, so that'll be a major improvement.<br /><br />Anyway.  Just checking in.
