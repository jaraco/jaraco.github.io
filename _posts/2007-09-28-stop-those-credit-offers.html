I couldn't believe <a href="https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t">how easy this was</a>.  Just follow the link, enter your information, and it removes you from the credit report agency lists for pre-screened credit offers.  Do the online option to be removed for 5 years, or print and mail a document to be permanently removed.  I used <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/pe_intro.php">FoxIt PDF Editor</a> to paste in my signature and <a href="http://www.postful.com/">Postful</a> to send off the letter electronically.<br/><br/>Fabulous!
