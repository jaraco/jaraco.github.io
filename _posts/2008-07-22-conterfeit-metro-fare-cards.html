I was offered <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/18/AR2008071801912_pf.html">one of these</a> about 5 days ago.  I wondered what the scam was.  I think on the same day I overheard some victims of the scam who had bought a card and then weren't allow to use it.  I definitely heard the word "counterfeit" while they were talking within station attendants.<br/><br/>When's metro 2.0 coming?
