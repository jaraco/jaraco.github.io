Apparently still in 2010, people are sending e-mails with long URLs in them which get broken by the e-mail line wrapping.<br/><br/>In case you're the recipient of one of these malformed URLs, I've created <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/54081/utils/url-fixer.html">a simple utility to repair the URLs for you</a>. Just copy the URL you received with all of the ugly line breaks into the text box, and you get a nice link to the target URL at the end.<br/><br/>It's not very robust, but it gets the job done.<br/><br/>(And now I hope others won't feel inclined to forward e-mails to me so that I'll do this for them manually).
