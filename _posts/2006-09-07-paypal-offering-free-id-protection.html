I found out today that <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> is offering <a href="http://www.paypal.com/idprotection">free identity protection</a> through Equifax.  If you have a PayPal account, you can receive free credit alerts via e-mail from Equifax.  Normally, they charge for this service, so I'm excited that I can now get these alerts for free.<br/><br/>If you don't already have a PayPal account, I'd recommend you get one.  It's one of the few services that allow people to send money electronically the way it should be done.<br/><br/>If you already have a PayPal account, check out the link above for more information about the free credit alerts.
