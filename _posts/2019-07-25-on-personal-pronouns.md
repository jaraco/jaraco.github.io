For a while, the introduction of new pronouns, individualized personal pronouns, has bothered me, and I've finally been able to put my finger on why.

The purpose of pronouns is to give the speaker an easy way to refer to the referrent, a shorthand. The only way this effort is an effective shorthand is if the pronouns can perform their duty in a generic way. As a referring construct is more specific to the referent, it becomes less useful generically and increases the onus on the speaker to capture details that are frequently irrelevant to the speech.

Historically, many languages assign a gender to these pronouns, and so when people feel mis-identified by these pronouns, their offense in understandable and justified, especially when one's identity is very strongly tied to a particular gender.

The solution, however, should be to remove the subject-specific aspects from the pronoun construct rather than to assign more and more subject-specific facets.

I for example identify much more strongly with the following attributes than I do with my gender:

- transhumanist
- intellectual
- atheist
- technologist
- empathetic
- human

Yet, the pronouns mainly available to me force me to identify as mainly male, female, or sometimes none-of-the-above. This feeling begins to touch on the feelings of disassociation and discomfort that I believe others feel much more strongly than I've had to bear.

And it makes me wonder, what is the value of associating gender with personal pronouns? Why not age or race or species or passion? Obviously because the practicality of such an endeavor would be untenable. You simply couldn't create enough pronouns to effectively capture every dimension of a person's identity and personality.

If we are to honor one's individuality, even assigning humanity or personhood to a pronoun could in fact be an offense to the subject's sensibilities.

For that reason, I've chosen to adopt the neuter pronouns (it/its) for myself, or maybe they/their (except the false plural nature really grates) to refer generically to other people... but mainly I'm going to avoid using pronouns wherever possible to avoid this whole mess.
