Today, the <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2326903,00.asp">FCC held that Comcast has violated Internet openness laws</a> and will likely be forced to stop with their broad and arbitrary blocking of Internet traffic.<br/><br/>This decision may herald the enlightenment when it comes to high-speed broadband service.  While I'm not particularly affected by the issue that brought this decision into the public spotlight (peer-to-peer services), I am hoping it will extend to their unreasonable blocking of traffic on port 445 (Windows Domain Services) without an exception process.<br/><br/>If so, this will make their service much more attractive to me.<br/><br/>Thanks FCC, for standing up for the minority.
