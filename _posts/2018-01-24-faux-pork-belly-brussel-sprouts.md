title: Faux Pork Belly Brussel Sprouts
---

Ingredients

1 bag brussel sprouts
1/3 lb bacon
1 Tbsp olive oil

Preheat the oven to 425ÂºF.

Slice the Brussel Sprouts in half lengthwise. Keep any leaves that become detached.

Place sprouts in a gallon Ziplock bag (or similar). Drizzle with olive oil a pinch of salt and pepper to taste (I used a generous portion).

Tumble the sprouts in the bag until they're coated. Place sprouts on a cookie sheet or baking pan in one layer.

Roast for 10-12 minutes.

While the sprouts roast, take the bacon, which is probably sliced and stack the slices on top of each other. Cut into 1/2" wide bites, keeping the slices together (simulating pork belly).

When the sprouts are softened and yellowing, place the bacon bites on top or around the sprouts and continue roasting about 5 minutes until the larger pieces are just starting to blacken and the bacon is sizzling and separating.

Remove from the oven and serve immediately.
