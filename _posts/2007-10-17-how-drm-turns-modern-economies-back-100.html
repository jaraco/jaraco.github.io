I'm sure you all remember the days of "Buyer Beware" (if only from U.S. history class).&nbsp; I've also visited 3rd-world and emerging industrial countries where the same principles apply (like the tourist infested markets in Beijing).&nbsp; There you can go and you can buy many items for much less than you would find them in the U.S.&nbsp; You can even buy items that aren't available in the U.S..&nbsp; Unfortunately, the quality and authenticity of those products are often lacking.<br/>Now with DRM, we're bringing back those good ol' days.<br/>Recently, I bought Catan, a remake of the Settlers of Catan board game, for the XBox 360.&nbsp; It was 800 points (or about $10).&nbsp; After I downloaded the game, I found out it only allows multiplayer online.&nbsp; In other words, you can play against the computer or against random strangers.&nbsp; If you want to play with 4 people in your home, you have to have 4 xboxes, 4 tvs, and 4 subscriptions to xbox live.<br/>Because that's how I wanted to use the game, I called customer support, but they were unforgiving.&nbsp; After you've paid your points, they're gone for good... and you can't re-sell the product either.<br/>Buyer beware.
